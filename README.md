# DSCI-Phishing-Email-Detection
## Created by Hung Do, Leland Ly, and Andy Chek

1. How to run:
    - Notebooks:
      1. Open the desired Jupyter Notebook
      2. Click "Run All Cells" to run all notebook cells and display results 
2. Challenges:
    - Data:
      - No pictures or links were included, making the dataset limited and unrealistic
      - Dirty data, sometimes crashing Excel
      - Potentially needing to expand beyond emails, such as from text messages and phone call logs
    - Project Development:
      - Punctuation is not understood as vocabulary
      - Our model doesnâ€™t work really well with tests outside the dataset as phishing is more and more complex
