# DSCI-Phishing-Email-Detection

1. How to run:

2. Challenges:
- Data:
  - No pictures or links were included, making the dataset limited and unrealistic
  - Dirty data, sometimes crashing Excel
  - Potentially needing to expand beyond emails, such as from text messages and phone call logs
- Project Development:
  - Punctuation is not understood as vocabulary
  - Our model doesnâ€™t work really well with tests outside the dataset as phishing is more and more complex
